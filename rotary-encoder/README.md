# Description
This tool allows using a KY-040 rotary encoder with `Mixxx` on a Raspberry Pi. The project is composed on the following:

* `knob_midi_startup.py`: Python script handling the hardware interrupts and translating them to MIDI commands, acting as a MIDI virtual device
* `ky040.service`: a systemd service file for starting the Python script at boot
* `ky040.midi.xml`: a mixxx MIDI controller file 

# Requirements

* A Raspberry Pi 3B or 4B
* A SmartPi Touch 2 case
* A breakout board for the KY040 rotary encoder
* Debian running on the Raspberry Pi

# Hardware instructions

First, follow the hardware instructions in `Hardware instructions.odt`.

# Installation
## Copying files
Copy the following files to their respective destinations:

* `knob_midi_startup.py` -> `/home/pi/`
	* This assumes that the user is `pi`
* `ky040.service` -> `/lib/systemd/system/`
	* If the user is not `pi` or if the Python script is located somewhere else than `/home/pi/`, then this systemd script must be edited
* `ky040.midi.xml` -> `~/.mixxx/controllers`

## Installing Python libraries
The Python script requires the `mido` library (https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and its `rtmidi` backend.

```bash
pip3 install mido
pip3 install python-rtmidi
```

## Starting systemd service
Enable and start the systemd service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ky040.service
sudo systemctl start ky040.service
```

Check the status of the systemd service:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ky040.service
```

It should return something like this:

```

```

## Enabling MIDI controller in mixxx
Start mixxx and enable the KY040 MIDI controller

# Usage

The current MIDI mapping is the following:
* rotating clockwise: zoom in waveforms
* rotating counterclockwise: zoom out waveforms
* pressing button: hide/maximize library

The mapping can be changed using mixxx's MIDI learning wizard.
